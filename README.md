# credit-risk-classification
Using various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers

Question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?

Healthy Loan (Label 0): The model's performance for healthy loans is exceptional, with a precision of 1.00, recall of 1.00, and F1-score of 1.00. This means that it almost perfectly identifies and classifies loans that are truly healthy as "0."

High-Risk Loan (Label 1): The model's performance for high-risk loans is also strong, with a precision of 0.86, recall of 0.91, and F1-score of 0.88. This indicates that the model effectively identifies high-risk loans, with a good balance between precision (minimizing false alarms) and recall (minimizing missed high-risk loans).

In summary, the logistic regression model exhibits excellent predictive performance for both labels. It accurately identifies healthy loans and maintains a strong balance between precision and recall when identifying high-risk loans. This balanced performance makes it a valuable tool for assessing credit risk, as it can effectively categorize loans into their respective risk categories.
